## How to use the file

1. To run (and knit) the project code, you will need to have Quarto <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>. Quit RStudio and install Quarto. When your reopen RStudio, it will already be set up.
2. The repository is now set up as an R Project. So you don't need to reset any paths. To open the project, simply double-click **ingredient-prediction.Rproj**. From RStudio, everything will be visible from the **Files** panel. Currently, the code is in **ingredient-prediction.qmd**. **That file should be opened from the project session**.
